# Learning Journal Day 2

Today we covered general html and css structures and js if/else statements. Of those, I'm struggling with css the most. I couldn't figure out how to add space between a section floated left and a section to the right of it. I should also look back at chapter 2 in the html/css book for html5 tag tips.

JS is straight forward at the moment. I am somewhat familiar with if/else, while, prompt, some functions.

ACP with git seemed really scary yesterday, but it made sense pretty quickly when I actually used it today.
