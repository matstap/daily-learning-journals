# Day 6

Today I learned about creating objects and accessing their properties, as well as how to render elements in the DOM.
I think I'm taking pretty well to working with objects. I'm getting tp the point of understanding with DOM manipulation, as it seems like the methods available define themselves.

I'm still going very slowly with CSS. I'm fiddling with each section for an hour to get a rough styling down.

It seems that my mathematics background is helping me understand objects, functions and loops, since they're essentially algorithms, but not at all with the styling aspect.
