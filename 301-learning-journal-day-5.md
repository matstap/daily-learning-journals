# Day 5

Today I learned hoe to add form data that returns an object using handlebars.js and jquery.
It was difficult to keep up with Brian in the tutorial, but the idea is very straightforward.
In the following weeks, I need to find time to review demo content because while I understand it now, I would be able to access the knowledge more quickly with review.
