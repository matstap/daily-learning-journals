# Day 5

Today I learned some practices for building a webpage that will really help with my about me page. I need to think of building it from the top left corner down, feature by feature.
Also, adding a clearfix really does solve most of my float problems (magically at this point).
I found that I had to turn on my linter, now it works and I fixed all the errors in my code.
